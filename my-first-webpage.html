    <h1> Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first webpage</p>
        <p>We learnt how to interact with the command line using various commands such as pwd, ls, mkdir etc.
            We also covered how to access the command prompt from anywhere on our computer.
            We set up Git in our projects.
            Used Atom to open our project file and edit our code.
            We learnt a variety of git commands that we can use in our projects to track changes we make in our projects, access and push our code to our repositories on Github.
            We also learned about the mark-up language used to create web-pages.
            Then we looked at the importance of indentation and spacing in HTML in order to make our HTML code easily readable.
            Finally, we created our first-ever webpage
